      <p>
        A card is a flexible and extensible content container. 
        It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.
        If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. 
        Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
